 * On-demand tool loading.

 * turn whether or not the model wants it. So in "ondemand" mode the model starts with a
 * bare *catalogue* — tool names only, appended to the system prompt — plus this one
 * meta-tool. It calls `load_tools` with what it needs, and the next round trip in the same
 * turn carries those real definitions.
 *
 * Names alone cost roughly a fortieth of what the schemas cost, so a turn that needs no
 * tools pays almost nothing, and a turn that needs three pays for three.
